Tic-tac-toe is played on a 3 by 3 grid of squares.

Player 1 uses X.
Player 2 uses O.

Players take turns placing their mark in an empty square.

The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

If all 9 squares are filled and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw.
